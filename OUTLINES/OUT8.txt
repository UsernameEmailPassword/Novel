	Lucius & Aneurin go to retrieve the package at the drop-off. 
(The package still has to be picked up as it holds secretive 
information and resources not to be commandeered.) At the
new town, Aneurin unintentionally gives away his identity to the grieving mom
of the hyena he killed.

	Also, more character development happens for Panama! The crow
traverses back home with his men, allowing for an insight into the Hunt's
structure, as well as his own personality.
