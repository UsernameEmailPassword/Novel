	Lux (Lucius) finds himself trapped in a cellar with a blind
bat named Leora, who's studying to become a doctor, and finds her blind and 
unable to fly.

#LEORA

	Leora is secretly (to Lux and the public) a vampire-bat; although
she isn't ashamed , she knows to keep a secret. Her eyes are milky white
from being blind most of her life. She can't remember pretty much any color
or shape's appearance. Her adoptive father is a hedgehog named "Aneirin."
She loves medicine, and treats the locals as a witch-doctor. Finally, 
she has no wings, having been mutilated as a youngling.

#DUMP FROM CHAT

	She has faint lines where they should connect with her arms, but nothing else.
Like, discolorations of the skin.
The other features of her's that I have down-pat so far are like
She's young-looking and a bit curvy.
Not like, voluptuous or anything.
But a bit of weight to breasts and hips/rump to fill the figure.
And a big defining feature is that she's blind.
Her eyes are a milk-white, with gray pupils.
Her hair is charcoal black with a streak of dusty gray.
