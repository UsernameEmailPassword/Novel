#LUCIUS
	Lucius is a liger descended from a sharecropping couple. Privately
educated, despite the prejudices of his peers, "Lux," as he became known as,
climbed the economic ladder to achieve wealth as an agricultural elite. Though
he usually maintains the diction of an upperclass living, his vocabularly is
frequently laced with breaks in formality, especially during times of distress.

	The liger values intellectual pursuits and cherishes his late parents,
though he finds himself nagged by a longing for company. Lucius's most prominent
shortcomings include his economically chary nature, coupled with a tendency for
hestitation and procrastination.

	Lux (Lucius) finds himself trapped in a cellar with a blind
bat named Leora, who's studying to become a doctor, and finds her blind and 
unable to fly.

#LEORA

	Leora is secretly (to Lux and the public) a vampire-bat; although
she isn't ashamed , she knows to keep a secret. Her eyes are milky white
from being blind most of her life. She can't remember pretty much any color
or shape's appearance. Her adoptive father is a hedgehog named "Aneirin."
She loves medicine, and treats the locals as a witch-doctor. Finally, 
she has no wings, having been mutilated as a youngling.

#DUMP FROM CHAT

	She has faint lines where they should connect with her arms, but nothing else.
Like, discolorations of the skin.
The other features of her's that I have down-pat so far are like
She's young-looking and a bit curvy.
Not like, voluptuous or anything.
But a bit of weight to breasts and hips/rump to fill the figure.
And a big defining feature is that she's blind.
Her eyes are a milk-white, with gray pupils.
Her hair is charcoal black with a streak of dusty gray.
