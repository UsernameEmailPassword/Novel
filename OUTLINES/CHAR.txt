	Lux (Lucius) finds himself trapped in a cellar with a blind
bat named Leora, who's studying to become a doctor, and finds her blind and 
unable to fly.

#LEORA

	Leora is secretly (to Lux and the public) a vampire-bat; although
she isn't ashamed , she knows to keep a secret. Her eyes are milky white
from being blind most of her life. She can't remember pretty much any color
or shape's appearance. Her adoptive father is a hedgehog named "Aneirin."
She loves medicine, and treats the locals as a witch-doctor. Finally, 
she has no wings, having been mutilated as a youngling.

#ANEURIN
	Aneurin is a black goat and former general in the war against the vampires, 
unbeknownst to his daughter.

#TWINLEAF
	Twinleaf is a reptillian scientist, and god-aunt to Leora who served under 
Aneurin in war.
