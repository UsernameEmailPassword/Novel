	Lux (Lucius) finds himself trapped in a cellar with a blind
bat named Leora, who's studying to become a doctor.

#LEORA

	Leora is secretly (to Lux and the public) a vampire-bat; although
she isn't ashamed , she knows to keep a secret. Her eyes are milky white
from being blind most of her life. She can't remember pretty much any color
or shape's appearance. Her adoptive father is a hedgehog named "Aneirin."
She loves medicine, and treats the locals as a witch-doctor.

	As Leora and Lux quickly get to know eachother, the scene 
ends with the assumption that they become familiar, leading into the next
part where they escape the cellar.
