Beginning:
	Lux , a lyger from a small trading town, visits a reservation for the Buffalo tribe
	"Apache," the last of their kind, aiming to slowly repopulate. While there, he is
	invited to partake in "firewater," during a party event for tourists to mingle with the
	Buffalo living on the reservation. Soon, he blacks out, awakening surrounded by fires,
	screams, and the smell of cooked bison, accompanied with ash and burning houses.
	Barely able to escape the ruined reservation, the injured cat returns home.
	A week(?) later, he receives the news in the paper: no known survivors. The buffalo
	population is presumably doomed, and to make matters worse, following an anonymous tip,
	Lux is brought in by the local police for "questioning," where he quickly becomes the
	prime suspect and subsequently the defendant.


Ending:
	After a long period of discovery, and a firey
