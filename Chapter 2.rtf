 Lux awoke to the smells of destruction, the cries of burning flesh. Immediately, a wave of adrenaline crashed over his hungover head, as he scrambled to his feet, clawing his way up onto the countertop to assess his options hastily. The floor around him was stone. }{\rtlch\ai\hich\af5 \ltrch\i\loch\f5\loch

 He rolled painfully behind the counter as the burning wood landed, narrowly avoiding catching fire, but falling square on his back, on the hard floor, in the process; the wind was knocked out of him. Struggling to breathe through the smoke and sparse oxygen in the air, the cat managed to spot the cellar door, just a few meters from where he laid. Crawling there took most of his remaining energy, but sliding the door out of the way was thankfully effortless.}

\tab One problem remained between the cat and safety. He needed to jump to land on his feet. He couldn't possibly climb in his current state down the cellar entrance, nor could he rely on a soft landing, being unable to see down into the seemingly endless darkness, despite his vision. His feet's springs had to save him, but he could hardly stay awake, let alone stand. So: he didn't. Rolling over onto his back, Lux was oddly calm with his next maneuvers; the alcohol had trapped him in a trance, combatting the panicky nature of adrenaline. The soot-covered, now fully blackened cat, inched forward towards the cellar, until his feet and much of his body dangled over the edge. With one final, and ceremonial push, he fell into the void, trying to stay in an upright position through the fall. }

 Smell the ashes," A young, feminine voice shattered the silence, as Lux came to, his eyes dilating to extreme proportions in a confused haze. A lamplight shone above him, but it was alone in a sea of shadow, offering his eyes only false hope of a reprieve from nothingness. Determined to sense beyond the void, the cat instead opened his ears, listening for a voice to reappear, or for any sound at all. }{\rtlch\ai\hich\af5 \ltrch\i\loch\f5\loch
